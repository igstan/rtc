CT_CHAR may need to be simplified for a better tradeoff
between cases handled in the macro and the size of the macro.

_setStringTag and _setUninitTag need looping and so may not be
macrofiable.

_setScalarUninitTag needs looping in all cases except when
the tag had been set to something of the same size before
(e.g. when the same stack frame is allocated to a function).
This is too much of a special case to deserve special handling.

tcapi-convoluted.h contains a backup of convoluted ps/is/ts version
(compatible with the even scarier pmirror-convoluted.c).
