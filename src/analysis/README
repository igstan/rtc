ISSUES:

 - TCA_BUF_SIZE (declared in tca.h) -- currently, if any
     lines in any -assign input file is longer than this,
     the behavior is undefined (it'll probably crash).
     A TODO would be to write a more robust input function;
     otherwise, an easy hack if such a long line is encountered
     is to just bump up this #define (only one buffer is ever
     allocated, so making it huge shouldn't hurt performance).
 - dataflow analysis: function call unsafe unless -callmeet
   - currently, by default, at a callsite, if there's more
     than one callee function, the post-fact for that node
     is the meet of the callee-return facts.
     However, it is pathologically possible that at run-time
     the call-node will resolve to an unmodeled function.
     The current solution is to turn on the -callmeet flag,
     which will meet the callsite facts with the callsite
     pre-facts.  A more elegant solution would be to identify
     the common case direct-calls, and callmeet for all other
     calls.
	~> fixed: currently, by default, don't meet with
	   pre-facts only if it's a direct call and not
	   recursive (and flag -callmeet is off) <~
